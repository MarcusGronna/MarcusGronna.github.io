                     <p> Hey there! I'm a passionate IT enthusiast from Stockholm, Sweden, with a love for web
                        development and full-stack technologies. I'm driven by curiosity and a genuine excitement for
                        learning new things every day. </p>

                        <p> I thrive on challenges, whether it’s solving complex coding problems, pushing my limits in
                           strength training, running, or practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I approach life with a blend
                           of
                           discipline, creativity, and a strong commitment to continuous personal growth. </p>
                        <p> Social by nature, I value meaningful connections and enjoy engaging with others. I believe
                           that
                           collaboration and sharing knowledge are key to both personal and collective success. I’m also
                           passionate about personal development—not just for myself but in helping others grow and
                           reach
                           their full potential as well. </p>
                        <p> With a humble attitude and an open mind, I’m always excited about the future of technology
                           and
                           the possibilities it brings. I’m particularly interested in merging my knowledge of sports
                           science and IT to create innovative, impactful solutions. Let’s connect and explore how we
                           can
                           collaborate and make a difference together! </p>

                  <p>To develop this program, I utilized my knowledge of JavaScript
                     fundamentals and array manipulation. I structured the code to use arrays for storing different
                     parts of the message, ensuring modularity and flexibility. Understanding randomization in
                     JavaScript allowed me to create a function that selects random elements from each array,
                     ensuring the generation of unique messages each time the function is executed. Additionally, my
                     familiarity with string concatenation enabled me to efficiently combine these elements into
                     coherent, motivational phrases. This project also demonstrates my ability to implement logical
                     workflows, breaking down the task into manageable components that work together to produce the
                     desired outcome.</p>

               <div class="toggle-text-portfolio-2">

                  <p>This project is a web-based game where the player uses arrow keys to
                     dodge falling obstacles. The game increases in difficulty over time as obstacles appear more
                     frequently, and the player's score rises with each passing moment. If the player collides with an
                     obstacle, they lose a life, and the game ends when all lives are lost. The player can restart the
                     game
                     by pressing "R" after a game over.

                     What I Learned
                     Through this project, I enhanced my understanding of object-oriented programming in JavaScript,
                     particularly in organizing code using classes. I also learned how to handle keyboard events for
                     smooth
                     player movement and implemented collision detection to manage interactions between the player and
                     obstacles. Working with the HTML5 Canvas API helped me gain practical experience in 2D game
                     rendering
                     and animation.</p>

               <p> Currently, I’m expanding my skills at
                  Högskolan Väst, where I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, database systems, and
                  design, including UI/UX. I’m also furthering my knowledge as a full-stack developer

                  Also, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Sports Science from Gymnastik- och
                  Idrottshögskolan, blending my interests in sports and human performance. I've been
                  working as a train driver since 2011, with experience across various companies
                  including freight, SJ, MTR, and Stockholm’s commuter trains. More recently, I’ve
                  combined my love for fitness and helping others by becoming a personal trainer.
